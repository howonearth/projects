# Family project: Dicover countries of the world

This Telegram Bot allows our family to keep track of the progress of our project. It has a list of functions accessible through the commands: 

* start (to start the conversation with the Bot)
* random (to get a random country from the list of countries that we haven't done yet)
* best (to get a list of dishes we liked the most, rated 7/10 and higher)
* help (to see the list of commands the Bot responds to)

When you press /start, the Bot asks you the name of the country you want to register in the data base as "done". After you give it a name, it updates the data and asks if you want to add a dish you've tried. After adding the dish it asks you to rate it from 1 to 10 and saves the data. You can proceed by adding another dish or pressing /done. When you press /done the Bot gives you a summary of what you've added (country, dishes, their ratings).
