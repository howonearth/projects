[Countries of the World](https://github.com/howonearth/projects/tree/dbdd309e1f6662ded8913815932c0713163b313b/countries-project-bot) - a Telegram Bot that supports our family project for discovering the countries of the world. It provides us with a random country, stores the countries we've already discovered along with the dishes we cooked from those countries and let's us rate them. We can later access the list of the dishes we loved the most.
